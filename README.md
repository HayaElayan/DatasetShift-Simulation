#Heterogeneity Simulator: Understanding Data Heterogeneity Impact on Model Performance

##Simulating Distribution Shifts and Their Effects on Predictive Models

- Despite growing awareness of data distribution shift and data heterogeneity, 
existing visualization tools are primarily designed for data scientists and model developers 
rather than for educational use. There remains a lack of accessible and interactive 
tools that can visually demonstrate and explore distribution shift and data heterogeneity and its impact 
on predictive models. Therefore, we developed this R Shiny-based simulation tool that enables learners to 
interactively explore various types of data distribution shifts and observe their effects on model performance. 


- This app provides an interactive simulation designed to explore the impact of heterogeneity within the development dataset on predictive model performance due to data distribution shifts, which occur when differences arise  in the underlying distribution of the data.
